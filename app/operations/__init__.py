    This function takes two numbers (a and b) and returns their quotient (a / b).
    Dividing means breaking the first number into equal parts based on the second number.
    BUT WAIT! There's an important check here: before we divide, we need to make sure that 'b' is not zero.
    
    Why? Because dividing by zero doesn't work. If we try to divide by zero, we get a big error!
    
    So, if 'b' is zero, we raise a 'ValueError', which is a way of telling the program, "Stop! You can't do this."
    Example: if we call division(10.0, 2.0), it will return 5.0.
    But if we call division(10.0, 0.0), it will raise a ValueError and say "Division by zero is not allowed."

    return a / b  # If 'b' is not zero, we divide the first number (a) by the second number (b) and return the result.
